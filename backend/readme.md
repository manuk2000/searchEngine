Title: Search Algorithm Description

Introduction:
- In the realm of data analysis and information retrieval, the ability to efficiently search through vast datasets is paramount. However, traditional search methods often encounter challenges when dealing with numerical data.
- This algorithm addresses the limitation where numbers are not directly searchable, offering a systematic approach to compare targets against values within a dataset to determine probabilities.

Algorithm Steps:
1. Comparison Probability Calculation:
    - At the core of the algorithm lies the calculation of probabilities for each comparison. This step involves:
        - Dividing the count of matching characters by the length of the target and multiplying by 100 to gauge the relative similarity.
        - Dividing the count of matching characters by the length of the value where a portion of the target is found and multiplying by 100 to provide additional context.
        - Combining these results by adding them together and dividing by two, offering a balanced assessment of similarity.

2. Probability Aggregation:
    - Once probabilities are calculated for each comparison, the algorithm proceeds to aggregate these probabilities for each target:
        - For every target, iterate through all values where it is found.
        - Assign a probability to each occurrence, encapsulating the likelihood of a match.
        - After scanning all entities, aggregate the probabilities for each entity, providing a comprehensive understanding of its relevance.

3. Result Sorting:
    - To present meaningful results, the algorithm sorts entities based on their probabilities:
        - Higher probabilities indicate stronger matches and are thus prioritized at the top of the result list.
        - This sorting mechanism ensures that the most relevant results are prominently displayed, aiding in decision-making processes.

Optimization Strategy:
- In pursuit of efficiency, the algorithm employs optimization strategies to streamline the search process:
    - When adding a character to the target:
        - Focus the search within the entities found before adding the last character, minimizing redundant comparisons.
    - Conversely, when deleting a character from the target:
        - Conduct a comprehensive search through all available information, ensuring no potential matches are overlooked.

Conclusion:
- This structured approach to searching not only addresses the inherent challenge of searching numerical data but also provides a robust framework for efficiently identifying relevant information within datasets.
- By leveraging probability calculations, aggregation techniques, and optimization strategies, the algorithm offers a versatile solution for diverse search tasks, empowering users to extract meaningful insights from their data.
